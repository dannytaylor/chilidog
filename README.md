```
$ sitegen
$ surge www
```

little project to learn about some things

my sanic comics with web pages built using [sitegen](https://github.com/dannytaylor/sitegen_comic) with moonscript and deployed using [surge](http://surge.sh)

also a basic refresher on css and html

this works for the # of comics I have and the frequency I make new ones, but using jekyll would probably make more sense in most cases.
