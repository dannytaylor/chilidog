```
$ sitegen
$ surge www
```

little project to learn about some things

my sanic comics with web pages built using [sitegen](https://github.com/dannytaylor/sitegen_comic) with moonscript and deployed using [surge](http://surge.sh)

also a basic refresher on css and html

this works since I only have a few comics, but since I have to rebuild and deploy the site for every change it's not a long term solution
